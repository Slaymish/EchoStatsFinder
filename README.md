Ensure your PC is connected to your headset (PC Users will have the option for entering a custom IP Address or leaving the IP and Port fields blank [which is recommended for PC Users], Quest and Standalone Headset users will **have to** connect their headsets to their PC by entering their headset's IP and Port number).
2. Click the Search Button.
